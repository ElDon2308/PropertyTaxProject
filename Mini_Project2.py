#Mini project

'''
A county collects property taxes on the assessment value of property, which is 60 percent of
the property's actual value. For example, if an acre of land is valued at $10,000, its assessment
value is $6,000. The property tax is then 72Â¢ for each $100 of the assessment value.
The tax for the acre assessed at $6,000 will be $43.20. Write a program that asks for the
actual value of a piece of property and displays the assessment value and property tax.
'''
'''
New task!
Make an actual list of properties(def made will have it read from a file) and see if you can make it look like a real list(going to attemp) and output a graph of price
compare the prices(def create) of each property and tell the user whats the best property based on the price
*Have to have a loop , write it too a file*
